## MBIHC

What is MBIHC? It's a Schiff base containing an indole moiety, a thiocarbazone group, and with favorable bidentate and tridentate coordination modes with iron, zinc, and nickel. Its complexes are of increasing interest to bioinorganic research and requires using state-of-the-art computational organometallic chemistry methods.

To that end we've used DFT to compute its molecular properties, using its provided IUPAC structure ((E)-2-((1-benzyl-1H-indol-3-yl)methylene)-N-methylhydrazine-1-carbothioamide) and generated a preliminary 3d structure via RDKIT, optimized by MMFF. We then used ORCA with the wB97X-D3 functional (more accurate than the workhorse BL3YP) and the def2-SVP basis set.
